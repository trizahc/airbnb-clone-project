 Project Description
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

 Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

- Learn to implement responsive UI/UX designs
- Understand how to structure a complex web application
- Practice working in a team with defined roles
- Develop skills in component-based frontend architecture
- Learn best practices for web application development

 Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
-Version Control: Git and GitHub
- Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design
- 17. UI/UX Design Planning

 Design Goals
- Create an intuitive booking flow for users.
- Maintain visual consistency in layout, typography, and color.
- Ensure fast loading times for all pages.
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness for better accessibility.

 Key Features
- Property search and filtering.
- Viewing detailed property pages.
- Secure checkout process.
- User registration and login (authentication).

 Primary Pages

| Page Name               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing View   | A grid display of available properties with filters for refining the search |
| Listing Detailed View   | A page showing full property details with images and booking form           |
| Simple Checkout View    | A page for final booking and payment confirmation                           |

 Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design makes the app easier to use, which leads to higher customer satisfaction and more completed bookings. Good UI/UX reduces confusion, supports quick navigation, and improves trust in the platform. A mobile-responsive, intuitive interface is essential for a positive user experience.

  UI Component Patterns

 Planned Reusable UI Components

1.Navbar
   - Contains logo, search bar, user navigation, and responsive hamburger menu.
   - Displays links to Home, Bookings, Login/Signup, etc.
   - Stays consistent across all pages.

2. Property Card
   - Shows property image, price, rating, location, and brief details.
   - Includes a favorite/heart button.
   - Used in the property listing grid.

3. Footer
   - Displays site links (e.g., About, Contact, FAQs).
   - Includes company information and social media links.
   - Copyright section.

 Why UI Component Planning Matters
Planning reusable components early helps ensure design consistency and saves development time. It also allows multiple developers to work on components independently without conflicts. Reusability improves maintainability and scalability as the project grows.
